# CVE-2021-38833 - SQL injection to RCE exploit in Apartment Visitors Management System (AVMS) v.1.0 
https://phpgurukul.com/apartment-visitors-management-system-using-php-and-mysql/

# How it works
The exploit uses an union-based SQL injection and into_outfile functionality to first upload PHP webshell on the server and then execute reverse shell payload (base64-encoded) on the target.
Tested on Windows 10 with XAMPP. If you want to use this exploit against other systems, you should find a location you have necessary privileges to write to and edit the shellcode (base64 encoded).
